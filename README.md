# Bella Ot√©r ‚Äì Mini Product Discovery Page üå∏

## Overview

This is a simple, mobile-first product discovery experience built as a coding test for the Bella Ot√©r Software Intern position. It simulates the first step of the Raven Body Profile by asking:

> ‚ÄúWhat does your body crave today?‚Äù

Users choose from four moods ‚Äî **Grounding**, **Softness**, **Energy**, or **Freedom** ‚Äî and are shown a matching product suggestion.

## If I Had More Time...

##  Time Spent
I worked on this project over a few days in short focused sessions, totaling around 6‚Äì8 hours.
Since I‚Äôm still learning React, I used this opportunity to understand component structure, state handling, and basic routing while building the experience.
I took my time to make sure the flow, mood logic, and mobile styling felt aligned with Bella Ot√©r‚Äôs tone.
