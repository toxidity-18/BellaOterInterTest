# Bella Otér – Mini Product Discovery Page 🌸

## Overview

This is a simple, mobile-first product discovery experience built as a coding test for the Bella Otér Software Intern position. It simulates the first step of the Raven Body Profile by asking:

Users choose from four moods — **Grounding**, **Softness**, **Energy**, or **Freedom** — and are shown a matching product suggestion.
